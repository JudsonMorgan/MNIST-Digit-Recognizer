# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
# Problem Definition
> A problem to carryout a comparative analysis on three machine models; Random forest classifier, LinearSVC and Logistic Regression. 
# Data
The dataset for this project is gotten from a competition on kaggle which uses the popular mnist dataset for digit recognition. link here https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv  The original dataset is in a format that is difficult for beginners to use. This dataset uses the work of Joseph Redmon to provide the MNIST dataset in a CSV format.


**data dictionary**


The dataset consists of two files:

* mnist_train.csv
* mnist_test.csv


The mnist_train.csv file contains the 60,000 training examples and labels. The mnist_test.csv contains 10,000 test examples and labels. Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).

# Features
The features used in this dataset comprises of a number from 0 to 255 which indicates the pixel values and the label is the first column of the dataset.
# Modelling
We carried out our modelling of three machine learning models so as to efficiently carry out the comparative analysis.
# Evaluation
We carried out our evaluation on the following parameters; accuracy, f1, precision, and recall score so as to determine the best machine learning model.
